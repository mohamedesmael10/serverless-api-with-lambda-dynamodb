# Serverless API with Lambda & DynamoDB

A serverless API built using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB that demonstrates how to create scalable, cost-efficient RESTful endpoints without managing servers. This project leverages AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB to build a robust CRUD API.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully serverless architecture by using:
- **AWS Lambda** for business logic and compute.
- **Amazon DynamoDB** as the NoSQL database for storing data.
- **AWS API Gateway** to expose RESTful endpoints.

It is designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and easy to deploy. You can quickly extend this API for various use cases.

## Features

- **Serverless Architecture:** No servers to manage â€“ everything runs on AWS Lambda.
- **Scalable Data Storage:** Utilizes DynamoDB for high-performance, scalable storage.
- **RESTful Endpoints:** Built with API Gateway to support CRUD operations.
- **Easy Deployment:** Supports automated deployment using infrastructure-as-code tools.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use.

## Architecture

The architecture of the project consists of:

1. **API Gateway:** Routes HTTP requests to the appropriate Lambda functions.
2. **AWS Lambda:** Handles business logic, processes incoming requests, and interacts with DynamoDB.
3. **Amazon DynamoDB:** Stores data in a NoSQL table and provides fast read/write performance.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if using Serverless Framework)
- An active AWS account with permissions to create Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway resources
